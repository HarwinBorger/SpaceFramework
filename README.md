# SpaceFramework 
The SpaceFramework is a SCSS framework build for front-end professionals and can be used to align elements pixel perfect on a virtual raster grid. The framework helps you with centralizing typography and the preserving of equivalent spaces between elements. 

Extensive knowledge of typography and alignments is required to use the framework optimally. Therefor a good collaboration between UX/UI designers and front-end developers is advised. 

Were most front-end frameworks focus only on the horizontal grid, the SpaceFramework works differently. Instead it has a strong focus on the vertical grid and the vertical rhythms. The horizontal grid is of course just as important. But there are plenty of those already. The vertical algorithm ensures you perfect balanced websites.

The core of the framework lays in the use of the so called Space-Units. With Space-Units, a virtual grid is created on which every element in the website is aligned on.

## Features
- Fixed units of measurement called 'space-units'
- Real vertical text alignment such as align-baseline, align-capline and align-median
- Grid
- Centralized typography
- Centralized spacing
- Trim, Fit and Force utility classes

## ~~Recommended to use~~
- ~~SpaceFramework is build on top of Foundation. However we made 
SpaceFramework to work without Foundation as well, but full power can be unlocked by combining them. (https://foundation.zurb.com/)~~
