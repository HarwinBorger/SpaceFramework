# SpaceFramework 
The SpaceFramework is a high-end front-end framework which focuses on delivering excellent and pixel perfect user interfaces. 

The purpose is create common vertical rhythm between components and typographic elements. This is done by centralizing all distances, alignments and font-presets. 

You can also use typographic alignments like:
 * Baseline alignments
 * Capline alignments
 * Median alignments
 * Cross alignments 
 
By centralizing similarities between main components, it fits well with the principles of Atomic Design.

The core of SpaceFramework lies in the use of a shared unit that connects all common parts. This unit is called the *Space-Unit*. 

## Recommended to use
- Space Framework is build on top of Foundation. However we made 
SpaceFramework to work without Foundation as well, but full power can be unlocked by combining them. (https://foundation.zurb.com/) 

## Installation

### NPM:
```
npm install spaceframework
```
