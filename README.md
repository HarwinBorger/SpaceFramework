# SpaceFramework 
The SpaceFramework is a front-end framework build in SASS which focuses on building websites rapidly, responsive and pixel perfect. The framework helps you with centralizing typography, centralizing layouts elements and delivering vertical alignment on typography and elements. Each component you create, can be placed modular in the website and writing exceptions belongs to the past.

Were most front-end frameworks focus only on the horizontal grid, the SpaceFramework works differently. Instead it has a strong focus on the vertical grid and the vertical rhythms. The horizontal grid is of course just as important. But there are plenty of those already. The vertical algorithm ensures you perfect balanced websites.

The core of the framework lays in the use of the so called Space-Units. With Space-Units, a virtual grid is created on which every element in the website is aligned on.

## Recommended to use
- SpaceFramework is build on top of Foundation. However we made 
SpaceFramework to work without Foundation as well, but full power can be unlocked by combining them. (https://foundation.zurb.com/)
