# SpaceFramework 
The SpaceFramework is a SCSS framework build for front-end professionals and can be used to align elements pixel perfect on a virtual raster grid. The framework helps you with centralizing typography and the preserving of equivalent spaces between elements. 

Extensive knowledge of typography and alignments is required to use the framework optimally. Therefor a good collaboration between UX/UI designers and front-end developers is advised. 

## How the SpaceFramework differs from common frameworks
Most front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and ZURB Foundation focus mostly on the horizontal grid, instead the SpaceFramework does focus on the vertical grid and the vertical rhythms. The SpaceFramework uses advanced methods based on theories from typography and grids to create vertical patterns. As result websites and applications feel smooth and pixel perfect balanced.  

The core of the framework lays in the use of the so called Space-Units and defining the x-height and cap-heights of fonts. With Space-Units, a virtual grid is created on which every element in the website is aligned.

## Features
- Fixed units of measurement called 'space-units'
- Real vertical text alignment such as align-baseline, align-capline and align-median
- Grid
- Centralized typography
- Centralized spacing
- Trim, Fit and Force utility classes

## ~~Recommended to use~~
- ~~SpaceFramework is build on top of Foundation. However we made 
SpaceFramework to work without Foundation as well, but full power can be unlocked by combining them. (https://foundation.zurb.com/)~~
