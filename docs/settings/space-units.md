# Space Units
#### The measurement system of the Space Framework is build with space units. This system of space units is one of the core elements of the framework

By adjusting the space-unit size for a certain viewport  you can up- and downscale the spacing of all elements within the website.

```scss
$space-unit-sizes: (
    small: .625rem,
    medium: .75rem,
    large: .8125rem
);
```
