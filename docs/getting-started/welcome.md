# Welcome
Thank you for taking interest in the SpaceFramework. 

The SpaceFramework is a front-end framework build in SASS which focuses on building websites rapidly, responsive and pixel perfect. The framework helps you with **centralizing typography**, **centralizing layouts elements** and delivering **vertical alignment** on typography and elements. Each component you create, can be placed **modular** in the website and writing exceptions belongs to the past. 

Were most front-end frameworks focus only on the horizontal grid, the SpaceFramework works differently. Instead it has a strong focus on the **vertical grid** and the **vertical rhythms**. The horizontal grid is of course just as important. But there are plenty of those already. The vertical algorithm ensures you perfect **balanced** websites.

The core of the framework lays in the use of the so called **Space-Units**. With Space-Units, a virtual grid is created on which every element in the website is aligned on. 

## Vision
With the SpaceFramework I want to reach perfection in typography and layout alignments. This I want to do by closing the gap between what a front-end developer can do and what a designer wants them to do. The SpaceFramework is build with typographical rules in mind. 

I don't want to give you pre-made components, since this only limits the designer. I'de rather focus on giving you the right tools so you can create own components and open your creativity. 

## Roadmap
* Horizontal alignment classes (v1.1)
* Horizontal grid system
* Horizontal column system
* Replace Grunt with Gulp / Webpack

## Documentation Roadmap
In this first version of the documentation we only explained how you can configurate the SpaceFramework.

* Applying the SpaceFramework on the documentation
* Showing and explaining the true power behind the SpaceFramework. 
* Adding examples
