# SpaceFramework 
Vertical Grid System: Brings cross-alignment back to the web

- Adding typography alignments have never been more easy, you can align on *baseline*, *capline* and the *median*. 
- Easy to include to your website by using *OOCSS* and *ITCSS* front-end patterns. 
- Exceptional equal sized alignments by using *global classes* to set *paddings*, *margins* en *positions*.
- Everything is build with one common size factor called a 'space unit'. Which combines typography and grid vertical alignments perfectly. 

## Recommended to use
- Space Framework is build on top of Foundation. However we made 
SpaceFramework to work without Foundation as well, but full power can be unlocked by combining them. (https://foundation.zurb.com/) 

## Installation

### NPM:
```
npm install spaceframework
```

## Documentation (work in progress)
