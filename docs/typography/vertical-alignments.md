# Vertical Alignments
What makes the SpaceFramework special is the vertical alignment of your elements. This can be done by using classes such as
`.align-baseline` `.align-capline` and `.align-median`.

- [Baseline alignment](#align-baseline)
- [Capline alignment](#align-capline)
- [Median alignment](#align-median)


- [Cross alignment](#align-median)

## Align baseline
By applying the css class `.align-baseline` on an **element** you can align all (defined) **children** of this element on the baseline grid. This includes headings, images, tables etc.

```scss
.align-baseline
```

## Align capline
By applying the css class `.align-capline` on an **element** you can align all (defined) **children** of this element on the capline grid. This includes headings, images, tables etc.


---
## Align median
By applying the css class `.align-median` on an **element** you can align all (defined) **children** of this element on the median grid. This includes headings, images, tables etc.

## Cross Alignment
By using the `.align-baseline` in combination with the `.shift` utility class you can align multiple columns containing different content with each other.
